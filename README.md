# LinkedList Data Structures in C++

# 📌 Overview
- This project implements various linked list data structures in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It includes Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List, and Circular Doubly Linked List.

## 🚀 Features
- Insertion at head, tail, and arbitrary positions
- Deletion by index/value
- Reverse operations
- Sorting checks
- Duplicate removal (sorted lists)
- Concatenation
- Statistical operations (sum, min, max)
- Memory-safe implementations with destructors

## 📋 Requirements
- CMake  3.10+
- C++17 compatible compiler

# 🏗 Future Improvements
- Add unit tests using Google Test (GTest).
- Standardize error messages and output across all linked list implementations, add detailed comments to clarify the logic, and optimize code for better performance.
- Refactor the `Delete` functions across all linked list implementations to use 0-based indexing instead of 1-based indexing for consistency.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/Shady924/Linked-List.git
2. Build the project using CMake:
  - cmake -S . -B build
  - cmake --build build
3. Run the executable:
  * On Windows:
    - cd build\Debug
    - LinkedList.exe
  * On Linux/macOS:
    - cd build
    - ./LinkedList
